Edit this file to fit your needs.

## Name and description

The `"name"` and `"description"` fields in `package.json` are missing, make sure to include them before you publish your package.

## LICENSE

I DID NOT include a license in this project as it is intended to be used as a template. Generate a LICENSE after you create your project, don't forget to declare it using your `package.json` `"license"` field.
